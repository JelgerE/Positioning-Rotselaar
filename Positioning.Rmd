## R Markdown

```{r read detection data}
# Detection data
path <- "./data/Detections"
filelist <- list.files(path, pattern = '.csv', full.names = T) #%>% paste(path, ., sep='/')

# Read data into list
det_list <- lapply(setNames(filelist, make.names(gsub("HR2-180 ", "", gsub('*.csv$', '', basename(filelist))))),
                    read.csv)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
