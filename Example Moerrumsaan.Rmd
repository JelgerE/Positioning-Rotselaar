## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
mdf <- moerrumsaan_df

detect_time <- iso2DetectionTime(mdf$time)

detext <- Detections(detect_times = detect_time,
                     detect_id = factor(mdf$id),
                     x=481472, y=6243500, send)
```


```{r}


seq(as.POSIXct("2021-05-18 18:00:00"),
    as.POSIXct("2021-05-19 06:00:00"),
    by=3600)

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
